/**
Run a job in a fiber, making sure never to run two simultaneously.

This semantics is useful for deferred jobs that need to collect or parse a state that changes. The number of jobs is
not dependent on the number of state changes.

The usage is to trigger the worker when the state changes. If no job is currently running, a fiber is immediately
launched to carry out the job. If the job is already running, it will trigger again once the current instance finishes.
