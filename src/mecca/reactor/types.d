  Base class for interrupting a fiber operation.

  This is the base class for exceptions that need to interrupt the operation of a fiber. This is the only type of
  exception allowed to escape the fiber code (any other type will be rethrown out of the reactor itself).

  It is discouraged to catch `FiberInterrupt` directly. If you do, please be sure to rethrow it.

  Catching custom classes that derive from `FiberInterrupt` is permitted.
